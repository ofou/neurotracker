    Keep track of Brain-Computer Interface startups, development, and key metrics

The main purpose of this project is to keep track of the current revolution of Brain-Computer Interfaces, especially Neuralink and related [companies](companies/companies.csv), universities and and research labs with invasive approaches. We keep track of interesting [papers](papers/papers.csv), and [key metrics](metrics/metrics.csv) for the field. 

We also followed closely key [people](papers/papers.csv) driving this revolution, [books](books/books.csv) published, and [funding](funding/funding.csv) sources for reference.
